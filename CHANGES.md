## 1.3.1 - (upcoming)
- Planned: Future upgraded release will introduce a second frontendâ€”a lightweight UI, possibly in Flutter, designed to run on a Raspberry Pi in kiosk mode. This app will:
    - Take over the screen in kiosk mode and display local clock, weather, tide, fishing, and hunting data.
    - Update data every 15-30 minutes throughout the day, and every other hour from midnight to 6am local time.
    - Support a user-adjustable schedule for switching between dark and light mode.
    - Keep the screen awake from 6am to midnight (with user-adjustable time range).
    - Allow configuration of schedule and display options.
    - Be optimized for always-on, glanceable display and robust error handling.
