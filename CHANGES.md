- Documentation: Added a section to the README.md listing all MCP servers and tools used to create and manage the project, including filesystem, GitHub, Brave Search, and sequential-thinking servers, with a summary of their capabilities.
- Maintenance: Added `.venv/` and `backend/.venv/` to `.gitignore` to ensure Python virtual environment files and folders are not tracked by git.
