# TODO for Location Selection & Proximity Features

## Next Steps

1. Automatically reload tide/fishing data when a new location is selected in the UI.
2. Allow users to fetch tide/fishing data for any selected town/zip (not just Stamford by default).
3. Add more towns/zip codes to `backend/towns.json` for broader coverage.
4. Improve UI/UX of the location selector (e.g., make it more prominent, add map view, etc.).
5. Handle geolocation permissions and errors gracefully in the frontend.
6. Optionally, cache recent location selections for quick access.
7. Add tests for new backend endpoints (`/locations/search` and `/locations/nearby`).
8. Document the new endpoints and frontend features in the project README.
